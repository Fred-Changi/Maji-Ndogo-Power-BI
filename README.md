# Maji-Ndogo-Power-BI
In this project we create dashboards to explore water scarcity and usage patterns in a country named Maji Ndogo, with multiple provinces.

In this project we have a hypothetical country, Maji Ndogo, where they have been having a big problem with providing adequate water services to their citizens.

The president of the country intends to deliver adequate water, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6,
which focuses on ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all.

The president needs dashboards that will help her to track the water usage of the people in the country, in terms of how many water sources have clean watere,
as well as how many people have access to the clean water or how many people share them. 
This will ensure that the president can adequately allocate funds to each province conisidering the number of people and number of projects.

To start, we started with identifying the different water source types, and the number of people they serve. This is just to get an overview of the types of water sources.

This showed us that most people use shared taps in the country and most of them are located in the rural areas. A good thing to consider is that fixing broken shared taps might be 
the project that will affect the most people.

Next, we looked at the queue times. This will help us to schedule projects, potentially when queue times are the lowest.

We see that queues are the longest on Saturday, which might be due to busy work weeks and Sundays being reserved to spend time with families or go to church.
Also, we see that in every province it is women who queue the most, which might show the cultural sentiment that women are the women to perform such duties.
Aside from Saturday, queue times drop at 9am and pick back again at 4pm.
We see a direct correlation between the number of people served and the average time in queue.

Next, we look at crime rates reported around the water sources. This will help to know how much securuty needs to be beefed up per province.

We see that most crime is in Kilimani, and the least in Amanzi. 
Also, females are most affected by crime around the water sources. Amanzi has the lowest crime rates, but it is worth noting they have the leat population of women.
Also, Amanzi might have the lowest crime rates because it is the smallest province.

We see most of the crimes happen after 6 pm. It would be good to deploy night time patrols to improve security.

Now, we look at the water sources in each province.

We can see that most people are served by shared taps, but also wells are the most in number in the country. It appears wells are not very popular in the country.

Next, we look at the water pollution per province.

Here we see Amanzi as green meaning it has the least level of pollution in its water sources. Amanzi might require the least resources, but more analysis is required to conclusively determine this.
Kilimani and Akatsi are red meaning they have the highest pollution levels in their water sources.

Next, we look at budgets.

Here, the president can use this dashboasrd to get an overview of the total budget of the country for each of the projects, as well as budgets for each province.
The president can also drill through to get the budget overview of the projects per province.

This can also be used for the respective province leaders to get their own reports.

Here the president can view the amount of project progress happening per province.
