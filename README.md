In this project we have a hypothetical country, Maji Ndogo, where they have been having a big problem with providing adequate water services to their citizens.

The president of the country intends to deliver adequate water, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6,
which focuses on ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all.

The president needs dashboards that will help her to track the water usage of the people in the country, in terms of how many water sources have clean watere,
as well as how many people have access to the clean water or how many people share them. 
This will ensure that the president can adequately allocate funds to each province conisidering the number of people and number of projects.

To start, we started with identifying the different water source types, and the number of people they serve.

This showed us that most people use shared taps in the country and most of them are located in the rural areas. A good thing to consider is that fixing broken shared taps might be 
the project that will affect the most people.
