# Maji-Ndogo-Power-BI
In this project we create dashboards to explore water scarcity and usage patterns in a country named Maji Ndogo, with multiple provinces.

In this project we have a hypothetical country, Maji Ndogo, where they have been having a big problem with providing adequate water services to their citizens.

The president of the country intends to deliver adequate water, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6,
which focuses on ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all.

The president needs dashboards that will help her to track the water usage of the people in the country, in terms of how many water sources have clean watere,
as well as how many people have access to the clean water or how many people share them. 
This will ensure that the president can adequately allocate funds to each province conisidering the number of people and number of projects.

To start, we started with identifying the different water source types, and the number of people they serve.

This showed us that most people use shared taps in the country and most of them are located in the rural areas. A good thing to consider is that fixing broken shared taps might be 
the project that will affect the most people.

Next, we looked at the queue times.

We see that queues are the longest on Saturday, which might be due to busy work weeks and Sundays being reserved to spend time with families or go to church.
Also, we see that in every province it is women who queue the most, which might show the cultural sentiment that women are the women to perform such duties.
Aside from Saturday, queue times drop at 9am and pick back again at 4pm.
We see a direct correlation between the number of people served and the average time in queue.

Next, we look at crime rates reported around the water sources.

We see that most crime is in Kilimani, and the least in Amanzi. 
Also, females are most affected by crime around the water sources. Amanzi has the lowest crime rates, but it is worth noting they have the leat population of women.

Now, we look at the water sources in each province.
